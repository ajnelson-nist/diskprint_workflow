	* Project: Long-overdue merge of 'unstable' branch performed.
	* Documentation: README and help flag of workflow updated.
	* Workflow: Now runs on Ubuntu 14.04.  Thanks to Jim Jones and Tahir Khan for early testing in Ubuntu.
	* Dependent software: All software with specific versions selected and built by the workflow is installed into a path within the workflow source tree.  Multiple versions of the workflow can run on the same machine (useful for development and testing).
	* Data model: Now based on lineage graph database table, instead of initial assumptions of tarball paths being sufficient to identify sequences.
	* Results: Now organized by graph concepts: by-node, by-edge, by-sequence.  Documented in README.
	* Results: New results based on file system differences represented as differential DFXML.  NSRL RDS format, CybOX format, and disk sector hashes are now produced for new and modified files.
